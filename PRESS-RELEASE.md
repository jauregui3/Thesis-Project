## Heading ##

 Ballhalla! A multiplayer browser-based game.

## Sub-Heading ##

 A fun low commitment game that players can jump into and out of on the fly

## Summary ##

 Ballhalla! continues the tradition of many other socket-based games, of fun intuitive high action and quick learning curve games for casual players. Players take the form of a rolling, bouncing, and boosting ball, with the goal of staying on top of the hill and kicking other players off of the main platform and into the lava zone. As you bounce more and more players off of platform your score will rise and you will bounce to the top of the leaderboard. If you get knocked off no worries, just log back in and start from the bottom and work your way back to the top of Ballhalla!
